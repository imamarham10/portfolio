            Developed an e-commerce platform facilitating direct trading between
            sneaker enthusiasts without intermediaries. Implemented a
            user-friendly interface using React.js, Redux and Typescript for
            frontend and Node.js and Express.js for backend allowing buyers to
            browse sneakers, view product details and multiple images, write
            reviews, add items to the cart, and place orders with PayPal
            integration. Incorporated a separate admin route enabling
            comprehensive product and order management. Employed JWT token
            authentication and leveraged MongoDB for data storage while
            utilizing cloud-based image storage of products with Cloudinary for
            optimized rendering.
